        <h1>About me</h1>

        <p style=" font-size: medium;">
            I am a U2 (Junior) undergraduate at McGill University in Montreal.
            I study computer science with a minor in math. My academic and professional
            interests include Machine Learning and Software Engineering.

            COVID analytics

        <p style="font-size: medium; margin-left:  0.75in;">
            This was a group project I did for
            <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2020-2021/courses/comp-551">
                COMP 551: Applied Machine Learning
            </a>
            at McGill University. We took data about search trends for items related
            to COVID-19 that were organized by time and region and analyzed them. In this project
            my contribution was to implement and run the machine learning experiments, and
            then perform validation by either testing the model on data from a different time
            or region. I used the scikit-learn library's implementation of KNN and decision
            trees in order to gain experience with industry level software.

            Softmax classifier

        <p style="font-size: medium; margin-left: 0.75in;">
            This was a group project I did for
            <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2020-2021/courses/comp-551">
                COMP 551: Applied Machine Learning
            </a>
            at McGill University.
            I worked in a group setting to implement Softmax regression and then apply it to
            a wide variety of datasets for classification. My contribution was two-fold. Firstly
            I implemented the Softmax function itself which provided an interesting mathematical challenge.
            Secondly, I modified our gradient descent optimizer to use Adagrad optimization as described
            in this
            <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.04747.pdf">
                paper
            </a>
            <br><br>
            Designing an implementation of Softmax turned out to be an interesting challenge mathematically
            becase the Softmax function is a mapping from R^n to R^n and therefore its derivative
            is represented by a n by n Jacobian matrix with n*n entries, but in order to be compatible
            with gradient descent, I needed a 1 by n vector, and ultimately was able to determine that
            the Jacobian diagonal was what I needed, however this with rather non-trivial.
            <br><br>
            Implementing Adagrad was much more straightforward and the only problem I had a chance to solve
            was working with the software engineering decisions my other teammates had made and working
            with those. Having to do this not only taught me about Adagrad but about communication in
            a software engineering context as well.

                Here I did a quick demo of the kNN algorithm which I learned about in my Applied
                Machine Learning class at McGill.In this demonstration I applied the kNN algorithm to some
                image data, both handwritten digits and pictures of politicians.<br>

                My goal in doing this was two-fold, number one I wanted to practice implementing
                an idea from class, and number two I wanted to familiarize myself with libraries such
                as numpy and sklearn before diving into the course content.
