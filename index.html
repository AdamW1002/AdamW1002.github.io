        <h1>About me</h1>

        <p style=" font-size: medium;">
            I am a U2 (Junior) undergraduate at McGill University in Montreal.
            I study computer science with a minor in math. My academic and professional
            interests include Machine Learning and Software Engineering.

            Prioritizing SMT Bug reports by Learning from Historical Patches
        </p>

        <p style="font-size: medium; margin-left: 0.75in;">
            This winter as part of my Honours Project at McGill, I will be working training a Machine Learning
            model to classify bug reports according to priority. I will be doing this for the common
            <a href "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisfiability_modulo_theories "> SMT</a> Z3 and CVC4.
            <br> <br>
            Stay tuned for more developments!

            Image recognition

        </p>

        <p style="font-size: medium; margin-left: 0.75in;">
            This was a group project I did for
            <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2020-2021/courses/comp-551">
                COMP 551: Applied Machine Learning
            </a>
            at McGill University. <br><br>
            <b>The problem</b>: Given an image containing up to 5 MNIST digits, recognize the order they're in
            and any blanks. For example, if the image contained "123" the correct output would be "1231010"
            where "10" symbolizes a blank space.<br><br>
            <b>The issues:</b> Training a neural network directly to do this impractical due to the multitude
            of possible outputs. To address this I employed an image segmentation system using scikit-learn.
            I wrote code to break the image into the digits that comprise it so that they can be individually
            recognized.

            COVID analytics

        <p style="font-size: medium; margin-left:  0.75in;">
            This was a group project I did for
            <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2020-2021/courses/comp-551">
                COMP 551: Applied Machine Learning
            </a>
            at McGill University. We took data about search trends for items related
            to COVID-19 that were organized by time and region and analyzed them. In this project
            my contribution was to implement and run the machine learning experiments, and
            then perform validation by either testing the model on data from a different time
            or region. I used the scikit-learn library's implementation of KNN and decision
            trees in order to gain experience with industry level software.

            Softmax classifier

        <p style="font-size: medium; margin-left: 0.75in;">
            This was a group project I did for
            <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2020-2021/courses/comp-551">

            </a>
            at McGill University.
            I worked in a group setting to implement Softmax regression and then apply it to
            a wide variety of datasets for classification. My contribution was two-fold. Firstly
            I implemented the Softmax function itself which provided an interesting mathematical challenge.
            Secondly, I modified our gradient descent optimizer to use the Adagrad algorithm as described
            by this
