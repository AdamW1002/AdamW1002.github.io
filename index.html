<h1 autofocus="">About me</h1>

<p style=" font-size: medium;">
    I am a U3 (Senior) undergraduate studying computer science
    at McGill University in Montreal. My academic and professional
    interests include Machine Learning and Software Engineering.

    Prioritizing SMT Bug reports by Learning from Historical Patches
</p>

<p style="font-size: medium; margin-left: 0.75in;">
    This winter as part of my Honours Project at McGill, I will be working training a Machine Learning
    model to classify bug reports according to priority. I will be doing this for the common
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisfiability_modulo_theories "> SMT</a> Z3 and CVC4.
    <br> <br>
    After early success scraping bug report data from Github issues and using it to train an RNN to
    classify bug reports as high or low priority based on a heuristic classification based on metadata,
    e.g. bug reports that go unaddressed for 6 months are probably not a priority, I was able to achieve
    testing accuracies in the 69-75% range, which were higher than those achieved during training!
    <br><br>
    My next step is to able to extract insights from the code itself. To accomplish this I will be compiling
    Z3 and CVC4 with a custom llvm pass that inserts a call to a logging function that runs before every single function
    call and logs what function was called and with what parameters. My goal here is to then be able to feed these logs
    into a neural network to aid in classification by providing more context to the bug report.
    <br><br>
    I managed to successfully implement the logging as you can see on my Github. However my current approach has a flaw
    simply starting z3 and closing it immediately produces a 9000 thousand line long file, and solving a simple SMT
    instance
    runs for more than 15 minutes and yields a multi-gigabyte log file. This clearly is untennable for longer programs.
    As a solution we're looking into smarter logging.
    <br><br>
    Many of the things logged aren't terribly likely to be useful such as constructors or minor functions. So the plan
    from here is to
    generate a call graph of all plausible calls from a static analysis, next I will traverse the graph with BFS
    generating a list of calls above a certain depth,
    likely 5ish. These will be the only calls I log going forward.

    The project is now done! You can see the full report and presentation here:

    Summer 2021
</p>

<p style="font-size: medium; margin-left: 0.75in;">
    This summer I will be working in Dr. Ronghui Gu's lab at Columbia University on extending his work in Machine
    Learning and formal methods.

    <br><br>

    This project will be about data-driven synthesis of SQL queries.

    Image recognition

</p>

<p style="font-size: medium; margin-left: 0.75in;">
    This was a group project I did for
    <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2020-2021/courses/comp-551">
        COMP 551: Applied Machine Learning
    </a>
    at McGill University. <br><br>
    <b>The problem</b>: Given an image containing up to 5 MNIST digits, recognize the order they're in
    and any blanks. For example, if the image contained "123" the correct output would be "1231010"
    where "10" symbolizes a blank space.<br><br>
    <b>The issues:</b> Training a neural network directly to do this impractical due to the multitude
    of possible outputs. To address this I employed an image segmentation system using scikit-learn.
    I wrote code to break the image into the digits that comprise it so that they can be individually
    recognized.

    COVID analytics
</p>
<p style="font-size: medium; margin-left:  0.75in;">
    This was a group project I did for
    <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2020-2021/courses/comp-551">
        COMP 551: Applied Machine Learning
    </a>
    at McGill University. We took data about search trends for items related
    to COVID-19 that were organized by time and region and analyzed them. In this project
    my contribution was to implement and run the machine learning experiments, and
    then perform validation by either testing the model on data from a different time
    or region. I used the scikit-learn library's implementation of KNN and decision
    trees in order to gain experience with industry level software.

    Softmax classifier

</p>

<p style="font-size: medium; margin-left: 0.75in;">
    This was a group project I did for

        COMP 551: Applied Machine Learning
    </a>
    at McGill University.
    I worked in a group setting to implement Softmax regression and then apply it to
    a wide variety of datasets for classification. My contribution was two-fold. Firstly
    I implemented the Softmax function itself which provided an interesting mathematical challenge.
    Secondly, I modified our gradient descent optimizer to use the Adagrad algorithm as described
    by this
